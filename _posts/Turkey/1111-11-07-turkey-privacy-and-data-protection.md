Turkey’s new Data Protection Law entered into force on April 7. Turkey’s new law is fairly similar to the EU’s data protection regime in many respects, but it also contains a few notable differences. In short, the Data Protection Law appears to represent Turkey’s attempt to harmonize its data protection regime with that currently in force in the EU, which Turkey still is striving to join. It remains to be seen how Turkey will enforce the law, and how the various provisions of the law will be interpreted, but in the meantime it is important for any company with Turkish ties to begin familiarizing itself with that country’s new privacy regime.
