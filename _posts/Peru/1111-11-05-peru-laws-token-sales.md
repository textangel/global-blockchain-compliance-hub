**Are ICOs and Token Sales Regulated source** [(source)](https://www.legalink.ch/xms/files/NEWS/Legalink_ICOS_and_Token_Sales.pdf)
- ICOs and token sales are not expressly regulated in Peru
- However, under the Peruvian Securities Market Law, there could be an interpretation that may consider cryptocurrency as a “security”, given its broad definition. If this is so, ICOs could be considered to be regulated under this law
- Peruvian regulator of the securities market (the Superintendencia del Mercado de Valores) has not issued any opinion to this effect nor has it issued any project suggesting any amendments to the cited regulation in order to include ICOs and token sales within the scope of the securities market regulatory framework. Therefore the regulation of token sales is ambiguous 

**Are there government agencies responsible for regulating ICOs?** [(source)]( https://www.legalink.ch/xms/files/NEWS/Legalink_ICOS_and_Token_Sales.pdf)
- There are no government agencies responsible for regulating ICOs and token sales as they are not expressly regulated in Peru

**Digital Proof**
As of July 2018, Peru has not created laws related to Digital Proof
