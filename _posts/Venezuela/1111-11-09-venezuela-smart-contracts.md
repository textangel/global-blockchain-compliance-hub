Electronic signatures and contracts are valid in Venezuela but seem to need to be issued by a Certification Service Provider approved by the [Superintendence of Electronic Certification Services](http://www.suscerte.gob.ve/) to have legal weight, according to the 2001 [Law on Data Messages and Electronic Signals](http://www.oas.org/juridico/spanish/mesicic3_ven_anexo19.pdf). There does not seem to be any regulation on the status of Smart Contracts specifically in Venezuela as of May 21, 2018.
