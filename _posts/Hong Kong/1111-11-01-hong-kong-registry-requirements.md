Once you have decided to incorporate a limited company and chosen a company name, you can apply for incorporation with the Hong Kong Companies Registry (“CR”). To simplify the process of setting up a limited company, any application for company incorporation includes a simultaneous application for business registration.

You may submit applications for incorporation of local companies online at the 24-hour portal [e-Registry](https://www.eregistry.gov.hk/icris-ext/apps/por01a/index) or via the “CR eFiling” mobile application which can be downloaded free of charge from App Store or Google Play, or deliver the documents in hard copy form to the CR with the correct fees.

The most common type of business entities in Hong Kong are sole proprietorships and partnerships. The other type of business entities and the detailed requirements are as followed:

1. Company limited by shares(Profit companies): the liability of members is limited by the articles of association to the amount unpaid on the shares respectively held by them. (For reference only: Most limited companies are companies limited by shares.)
