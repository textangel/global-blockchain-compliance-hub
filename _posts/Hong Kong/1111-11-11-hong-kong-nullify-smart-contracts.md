Since we’re at the beginning of the application of the Blockchain Technology to different sectors, there are no cases of smart contracts being nullified so far. The only related subject is regarding the protection of privacy and personal data and ‘right to be forgotten’. As it is explained further in the [‘Related to Privacy Rights and Personal Data’](https://neo-project.github.io/global-blockchain-compliance-hub//hong-kong/hong-kong-privacy-and-data-protection.html) section, the legislation regarding that issue is still not clear.
