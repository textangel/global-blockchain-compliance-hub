A Hong Kong company must hold an annual general meeting in every calendar year when, among other things, the audited accounts of the company are adopted. An annual return of the company must also be filed with the Companies Registry every year. In addition to the delivery of Annual Returns for registration, registered companies are required to deliver other statutory documents to the Registrar of Companies for registration in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Ordinance such as notices of change of address of registered office or principal place of business in Hong Kong, directors and company secretaries and their particulars, etc. 

Companies and their directors, company secretaries, authorized representatives or managers must ensure strict compliance with the Companies Ordinance in the delivery of statutory returns to the Companies Registry for registration. You can visit the [Hong Kong e-Legislation](http://www.elegislation.gov.hk/) of the Department of Justice to read the full text of the [Companies Ordinance](https://www.elegislation.gov.hk/hk/cap622@2014-03-04T00:00:00?p0=1&p1=1).
