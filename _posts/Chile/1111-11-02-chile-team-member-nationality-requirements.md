Under Chilean regulations, 100% of the partners of an entity can be foreigners.

One of the legal representatives of the entity must be Chilean or a foreigner with a Chilean residence.
However if you are a non-Chilean citizen, registering as a Chilean resident entitles you to the same benefits and rights as a Chilean citizen, which include:
- Being able to apply for loans and mortgages
- Being allowed to drive a car
- Having access to a bank account and credit
- RUT ( a.k.a. taxpayer ID)
- Not being deported if you break the law
- Vote (only after 5 years of residency)

It is easier and cheaper to obtain a permanent Chilean residency when you start a new business in Chile.
