There are a few Laws Related to Token Sales, Blockchain, and Digital Proof in the Korean Legal System:

-	The Electronic Financial Transactions Act 
-	The Act on the Development of Cloud Computing And Protection of Its Users 
-	Framework Act On Electronic Documents And Transactions 
-	Digital Signature Act 

The most relevant and detail Law by the end of 2017 is The Electronic Financial Transactions Act.

A blockchain company, planning to issue and manage electronic currencies shall obtain permission from the Financial Services Commission, according to the **Article 28 of The Electronic Financial Transactions Act:**

Managing electrocnic currencies includes one or more following services:
1. Electronic funds transfer services;
2. Issuance and management of electronic debit payment means;
3. Issuance and management of electronic prepayment means;
4. Electronic payment settlement agency services;
5. Other electronic financial services prescribed by Presidential Decree.

However, if a company only provides agent services, such as delivering information only for the electronic processing of electronic payment transactions without direct involvement in the transfer of funds, it doesnâ€™t have to obtain permission from the Financial Services Commission to operate its business. Article 28 (2).
