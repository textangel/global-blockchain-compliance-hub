Laws regulating the sale of securities and ICOs in the United States are being developed primarily at the federal level, in particular by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). So far there does not seem to have been any kind of special regulations of ICOs in California on top of what has been put in place by the federal level. Refer to the [United States Securities-related laws section](https://neo-project.github.io/global-blockchain-compliance-hub//united-states-of-america/USA-securities-related-laws.html) on the left-hand menu bar.
