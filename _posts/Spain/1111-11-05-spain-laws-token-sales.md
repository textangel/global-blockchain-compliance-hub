The countries of the European Union hold a patchwork of individual attitudes towards cryptocurrency regulation, but all of them also fall under the jurisdiction of the EU Commission. For EU regulations, please visit [EU Laws Related to Token Sales, Blockchain, and Digital Proof](https://neo-project.github.io/global-blockchain-compliance-hub//europe/europe-laws-token-sales.html).

# Token Sales (“ICOs”)
In a [joint press statement](https://www.iosco.org/library/ico-statements/Spain%20-%20CNMV%20and%20Banco%20de%20Espana%20-%20Joint%20Statement%20on%20Cryptocurrencies%20and%20ICOs.pdf) with the Bank of Spain in February 2018, the National Securities Market Commission (“CNMV”) emphasized that, to date, *“no cryptocurrency issue or ICO [had] been registered, authorised or verified by any supervisory agencies in Spain…”* adding that, *“there are no ICO-issued cryptocurrencies or tokens purchased or held in Spain that may avail of any of the guarantees or safeguards envisaged under the regulations on banking or investment products.”*

While there is not a mature legal framework for token sales at this time, it has been reported that [members of a Spanish political party](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-15/rajoy-s-party-weighs-tax-breaks-for-spanish-blockchain-companies) are actively working on ICO-friendly legislation, including otential tax breaks.


# Blockchain
In July 2018, Generalitat de Catalunya (Government of Catalonia) revealed a plan for blockchain implementation. The Generalitat de Catalunya, which is an official institution of the Spanish government for the autonomous province of Catalonia, is going to promote crypto-technology “with the aim of improving digital services to the public and promoting the potential of this technology between the Administration, companies and the citizen(s)."
