### For Profit Requirements
#### Legal means to formalize your company
View accurate information about the main legal means provided for in our legislation for the exercise of any business activity, as well as the most relevant features for each of these characteristics.
 
##### 1. Number of individuals who can create the company:
Once the prospective employer has identified and established the business activity it is going to undertake, it must determine the number of people involved in the creation of the company, hence it will have two options in the face of such situation. 
 
If the employer has decided to undertake its business or economic activity individually, it will have three possibilities: to exercise its business as a natural person, duly registered before the chamber; as a sole proprietorship; or as a sole shareholder in a Simplified Joint Stock Company. 
 
Conversely, if the entrepreneur has decided to face the implementation of its business with two or more people, through any of the main forms of association, it will under such circumstances have the opportunity to choose between one of the trading partnerships, an associative labor enterprise, or an agrarian transformation company.
 
Documents required in order to register as a company with the CCB:
- Your personal ID. 
- Single Fiscal Registrar (RUT) form. 
- Forms available at the [CCB's offices](https://www.ccb.org.co/en/The-Chamber-CCB/Our-offices). 
- [Unified Commercial and Social Registry (RUES) 2017](https://www.ccb.org.co/content/download/3563/635444/file/FORMULARIO_RUES_HOJAS_1_Y_2.pdf)  (spanish version). 
- [Additional registration form for other institutions](https://www.ccb.org.co/content/download/4736/892454/file/Formulario_adicional_registrocon_otras_entidades_nov24.pdf)  (spanish version).
 
This form is used by the CCB to send information to the District Secretary of Revenue in order to complete the registration into the Fiscal Information Registrar (RIT), as long as your commercial activities will take place in Bogot√°, and are taxed with the Industry and Trade Tax (ICA).
Bear in mind that these forms must be filled out completely and signed by the individual or the company's legal representative.
 
Recommendations when filling out the forms:
- Make sure that the name in the RUT form is identical to the one in the Single Enterprise and Social Registration Form (RUES), as well as in the additional registration form for the other institutions. 
-  Make sure that the telephone number in the RUT form is identical to the one in the RUES form, as well as in the additional registration form for the other institutions.
All forms are available in all of the [CCB's Enterprise Sites](https://www.ccb.org.co/en/The-Chamber-CCB/Our-offices).
 
##### 2. Developing a company individually:
Entrepreneurs can formalize their companies under any of the following legal modalities: 
- Individual Merchant
- Sole Proprietorship
- Joint Stock Companies
 
##### 3. Development of a company made up of two or more individuals: should the entrepreneurs decide to carry out their economic activity jointly with one or more individuals, please consider the following: 
Profit-oriented partnership modalities
The most common profit-oriented partnership modalities include:
- Commercial Companies
- Limited Partnership
- Collective Partnership
- Anonymous Corporation
- Company Limited By Shares
- Associative Work Business

##### 4. Establishment of the business: 
as a structural element in corporate organization, it has been defined by the [Commercial Code](https://www.ccb.org.co/content/download/4714/160323/file/Codigo%20Comercio.pdf)  (spanish version) as a set of assets or goods organized by the entrepreneur in order to carry out the company's purposes.  A single person may own several commercial establishments and, in the same fashion, a single commercial establishment may belong to several individuals and may be used for the execution of several activities. 
In this matter, it is worth noting that commercial companies may carry out the purposes foreseen in their corporate purpose through the following kinds of establishments: Agencies; Branches; Establishments as such; According to commercial law, the commercial establishment is comprised by:
- The commercial name and the brands for products and services.
- The rights of entrepreneurs over inventions or industrial or artistic creations used in the establishment's activities. 
- The goods in the warehouse or being produced, loans and other similar amounts. 
- The commercial rights and obligations derived from those activities that are inherent to the establishment, as long as they are not coming from agreements signed exclusively to the benefit of the owner of said establishments. 
- Lease contracts and, in case of transfer o negotiation, the right to lease the real estate they operate from, if owned by the entrepreneur; and any indemnifications that the lessee is entitled to under the law.
- The right to prevent the deviation of clients and to the protection of goodwill.
