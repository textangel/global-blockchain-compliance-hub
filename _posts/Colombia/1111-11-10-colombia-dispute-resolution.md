Colombia has not clarified an official regulation on this issue, however in May 2018, Representatives of six leading companies in the development and operation of markets for Bitcoin in Latin America made official the creation of Blockchain Colombia, a new partnership that will lead the efforts to develop and implement this financial technology in the country.

In the same Month, Colombia also welcomed citizen participation in the development of a regulatory framework.
