One can find a clear guide towards drafting Singaporean Company constitutions and abiding with regulations [here](https://www.startupdecisions.com.sg/singapore/company-law/company-constitution/).
In Singapore, company bylaws are called the Company Constitution (Prior to 2014, the Memorandum & Articles of Association and Articles of Incorporation). The requirements for the company constitution are laid out in Part III of the Singapore Companies Act, linked [here](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/CoA1967#pr17-).
As per the law the constitution must include: 
   * The name of the company 
   * The liability of the company members - is the company limited by shares, limited by guarantee, or unlimited company 
   * The location of the registered office of the company 
   * The share capital amount amount of the company and the division of the capital into fixed value shares. 
   * the full names, addresses and occupations of the subscribers to the constitution of the company, and how many shares they each take 
   * The objective of the company 
   * Regulations for the company (III 2(34)) 
And the constitution may include: a provision restricting its capacity, rights, powers or privileges. (III 2(23)(1B)) 

Check the [Company Act](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/CoA1967#P1III-) for the full details.
The Singaporean government has published model constitutions for private companies limited by shares or guarantee [here](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/SL/CoA1967-S833-2015?DocDate=20151231&ProvIds=Sc1-.), which can be taken in part and adapted into a company constitution.
