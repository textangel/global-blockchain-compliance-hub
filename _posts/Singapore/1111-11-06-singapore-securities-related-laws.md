Singapore has no capital gains tax.

The [Securities and Futures Act](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/SFA2001#P1XIII-) (SFA), Part XIII: Offers of Investments, is the main relevant security law present here. This law is worth referring to in detail. It mandates that products determined to be securities (including some ICOs deemed to be securities offerings, see above discussion) will have to
   * Register a prospectus 
      * See legal details about prospectus content requirements [here](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/SFA2001#pr243-). 
   * Obtain intermediary or exchange operator licenses 
   * Perform mandatory compliance with anti-money laundering and anti-terror financing laws 

A list of all the licenses that may be required of a fintech startup in Singapore is [here](http://learn.asialawnetwork.com/2016/10/24/fintech-regulations-in-singapore-what-you-need-to-know-simplified/).
