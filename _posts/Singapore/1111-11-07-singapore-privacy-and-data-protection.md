The below is summarized from [this resource](http://learn.asialawnetwork.com/2016/10/24/fintech-regulations-in-singapore-what-you-need-to-know-simplified/), which is a clear and thorough guide to regulation for those hoping to set up fintech startups in Singapore (as of October 24, 2016).
There are three main laws in Singapore related to data security in Singapore.

### Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA).

      * Prepare the company’s personal data privacy policy to be made available to the public 
      * Implement the personal data privacy policy 
      * Appoint a data protection officer 
      * Build in physical and computer safeguards to wrongful access of data 
      * Control and limit access to personal data to key authorized personnel
