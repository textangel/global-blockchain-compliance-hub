Literature on smart contracts currently lacks a discussion of the legal implications of those use cases that are unrelated to contract law. Although there is no official statement on smart contract regulation in Sweden presently on offer, the Swedish government is currently using smart contracts in a real estate land registries project. 
 
The rise of blockchain technologies has popularised the notion of online ledgers of assets where entries on the ledger are "tokens" for real-world assets. The Swedish, is testing a system for registering and recording land titles that utilizes blockchain in a bid to digitize real estate processes.
 
[Lantm√§teriet, or the Swedish National Land Survey](https://www.lantmateriet.se/en/Real-Property/), is working with blockchain startup [ChromaWay](https://www.coindesk.com/lhv-bank-backs-wallet-app-built-on-bitcoins-blockchain/), consulting firm Kairos Future and telephone service provider Telia to use blockchain and smart contracts in land registry. [1]
The project could have implications on emerging smart contract law and clarifications  on smart contracts, liability, and blockchain regulation as applied to other fields.
