The basic rule for personal data processing under the Czech Act on [the Protection of Personal Data No. 101/2000 (the Act) ](https://www.uoou.cz/en/vismo/zobraz_dok.asp?id_ktg=1107  is that the controller may process personal data only with the consent of data subject (Article 5(2) of the Act).)

Based on [the Act on the Cybersecurity No. 181/2014](https://www.govcert.cz/download/legislation/container-nodeid-1122/actoncybersecuritypopsp.docx) , it is obligatory to notify a data breach to a public authority in cases of critical infrastructure data breaches.
