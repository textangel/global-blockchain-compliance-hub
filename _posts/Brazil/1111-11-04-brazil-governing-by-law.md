**Articles of Association**

The Brazilian Articles of Association, known as **Contrato Social** in Portuguese, is the official document that is required for formalizing a business partnership and one of the first steps for legally registering a company.

The registration of a business partnership is formalized through a Contrato Social, which defines the rules, rights and duties of the each of the partners in the company. The Contrato Social must contain a certain amount of mandatory information specified by DREI, short for **Departamento de Registro Empresarial e Integração**. This department is responsible for the coordination of all Boards of Trade, or Junta Comercial in Portuguese, in each state.

The following information is required on a Contrato Social:
- Título, which is the heading
- Preâmbulo, which is detailed information about the partners and representatives of the partnership
- Corpo do contrato, which is content where the clauses of the articles of association are described
- Fecho, or closing where the signatures are provided

**Business and Company Laws in Brazil**

Extensive   legal    reforms consequently  followed suit  to  help Brazil’s  legal  framework keep 
pace with rapidly changing economic realities, particularly enhanced foreign investment opportunities. A  key legal  reform  was the  1995  Amendment to  the  1988 Federal Constitution,   which   removed  foreign   investment   restrictions in  certain  economic sectors,  including  petroleum, mining, domestic transportation and local gas service activities, by revoking provisions which distinguished between a Brazilian company (any company incorporated in Brazil) and a Brazilian company of national capital (a company incorporated in Brazil that was  effectively controlled, directly or indirectly, by persons physically domiciled  or  resident in  the  country or  by  Brazilian public   entities).   Foreign  investment   restrictions   remain  in   certain   areas, however,  such  as nuclear  energy,  rural property  ownership,   border  activities,   mail   
and  telegraph,   domestic aviation  and  aerospace. In  addition,  foreigners cannot  hold  more than  30  percent of  Brazilian  press and  broadcasting  companies.  Foreign  investors  have
responded favorably  to  Brazil’s market  and   legal  reforms,   establishing   domestic  market   presence through  a variety  of  investment structures.  Distribution  and sales   representation   agreements  with   Brazilian   individuals and/or   companies   may  be   used   as  preliminary   investment vehicles  to  survey the  Brazilian  market and  often  precede the  establishment   of   
a  direct   local   presence.  Where   market   conditions support  a  local presence  and  associated investment  costs,  many foreign  investors  establish a  Brazilian  subsidiary. Alternatively,  foreign  investors may  seek  to conduct  activities  through a  joint  venture with,  or  acquisition of,  all  or part  of,  a knowledgeable,  experienced  and connected  local  company to  complement their strengths. This paper will briefly review each of  these   investment   alternatives   and  other   key   foreign  investment considerations.[6]
 
The Brazilian judiciary is an independent system,ruled by law, with administrative and financial autonomy under the Federal Constitution. Its primary function is to resolve conﬂicts and enforce
individual, collective and social rights. It is composed of several courts distributed among federal
and state levels, with the Federal Supreme Court“Supremo Tribunal Federal” (STF), made up of 11 justices, being the country’s highest court. The Federal Supreme Court is the body ultimately  responsible for the interpretation and enforcement of the Constitution. Under it is the Superior Court of Justice (STJ), which is responsible for the uniform interpretation of federal legislation, as  well as the regional federal, state and specialized courts. Brazil’s judiciary has three specialized courts dealing with matters outside general jurisdiction: Labor, Electoral and Military, each of them with their own regional and superior courts. They are headed, respectively, by the Superior  Labor Court (TST), the Superior Electoral Court (TSE) and the Superior Military Court (STM).
 
Foreign capital is defined under Brazilian law as being any assets, machinery or equipment  entering Brazil from abroad, as well as financial or monetary resources, intended for the  production of goods and services or to be used in economic activities in the country. In all cases, it must belong to individuals or legal entities residing, domiciled or headquartered outside Brazil.
 
Brazilian law allows for mergers and acquisitions(M&A) by foreign investors. No special rules  apply, although FDI remains restricted in certain sensitive and strategic sectors listed below. Brazil’s official competition and antitrust regulator is the Brazilian Antitrust Authority (Cade), a  federal body related to the Ministry of Justice and responsible for preventing, adjudicating and   punishing acts of abuse of market power. Cade’s work is paired with the Economic Supervision  Office (SEAE), which, under the Ministry of Finance, is responsible for developing policies  regarding market regulation and competition. For M&A operations involving financial institutions,  the main regulator is the Central Bank of Brazil. Since 2012, a new antitrust framework (Law 12,529/2011) has governed the competition protection system. It was designed to reformulate Cade’s workﬂow and accelerate decision-making on issues regarding competition. According to the watchdog institution, the average length of a merger analysis was lowered from 154 days in  2011, before the law came into force, to 31 days three years later. To further improve M&A regulations in Brazil, the Brazilian Mergers and Acquisitions Committee (CAF) was created in  November 2012. The CAF brings together participants of the financial market and the São Paulo  Stock Exchange (BM&F Bovespa) and is based on the United Kingdom’s Panel on Takeovers and Mergers. The Brazilian M&A Committee oversees a monitoring framework based almost entirely on self-regulation by publicly traded companies and has become a corporate governance quality  seal for M&A transactions involving companies that have voluntarily adhered to its rules.
