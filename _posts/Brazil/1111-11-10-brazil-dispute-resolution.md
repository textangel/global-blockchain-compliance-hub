Mediation and Conciliation are the most used ADR methods in Brazil since the parties must attend a mediation or conciliation session prior to appearing before a judge (see Part 1, question 10.1) and the proceedings before Brazilian Small-claims courts provide for mandatory sessions of conciliation. Arbitration is also a commonly used ADR method.Other forms of ADR are uncommon.
