### Parliamentary debate
Overall, Luxembourg has a positive attitude towards fintech and cryptocurrencies. It issued the first national license as a regulated Payment Institution to Bitstamp, making it the first fully-licenses bitcoin exchange in Europe, back in July 2016. Luxembourg’s Minister of Finance Pierre Gramegna stated, “Luxembourg has a longstanding history as an international leader in innovation. That Bitstamp has chosen Luxembourg as its European hub only strengthens that reputation. I believe this announcement marks a milestone for bitcoin and digital finance in Europe. Bitstamp is a most welcome addition to Luxembourg’s Fintech ecosystem.” On January 23, 2018, the Japanese cryptocurrency exchange BitFlyer obtained a license as well. C2Cx, an exchange focused on the Chinese market, is also registered in Luxembourg.
