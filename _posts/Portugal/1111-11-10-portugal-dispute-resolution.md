For EU regulation, please visit [Europe: How is Dispute Resolution Integrated.](https://neo-project.github.io/global-blockchain-compliance-hub//europe/europe-dispute-resolution.html)
 
According to the limited information available on the new Portuguese regulatory framework, [1] when it comes to dispute resolutions, "payment service providers are obligated" to work with dispute resolution organizations on potential disputes. The government also plans to introduce "reporting mechanisms for payment service providers and for electronic money issuers, as well as for the respective supervisory authority."
