You need to have a Portuguese residence permit (or a Certificate of Registration if an EU/EFTA citizen who has been a Portuguese resident for less than 5 years) to start a business in Portugal. 

Non-EU/EFTA nationals wanting to come to Portugal to start a business or work as a freelancer will need to obtain a Portuguese work visa and residence permit. 

Non-EU/EFTA nationals interested in investing money into Portugal might qualify for the Golden Visa programme which is designed to attract foreign investment. 

Citizens from EU/EEA/Switzerland do not require any Portuguese work visa to live or work in Portugal. However, those who come to work in Portugal for longer than six months with need to obtain a Residence Certificate (Certificado de Registo). See [this guide](https://www.expatica.com/pt/visas-and-permits/portugal-immigration-policy-eu-and-family-members_936493.html) to Portuguese immigration policy for EU nationals.

Most non-EU nationals will need a Portuguese work permit before they can undertake employment in Portugal. In the majority of cases, a Portuguese work permit is only granted to non-EU nationals if a secure job has been offered or if the individual is married to a Portuguese citizen. If approved, they can continue the process of obtaining a Portuguese work visa or residence permit.
