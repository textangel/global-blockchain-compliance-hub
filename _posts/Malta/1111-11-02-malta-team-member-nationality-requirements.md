A company -whether it's a private limited or public limited company- generally cannot be formed with fewer than two shareholders, who may be natural or legal persons, but there are no requirements regarding nationality or residence. 
 
A company, formed outside of Malta and wanting to operate in the country, can open a permanent representative office or branch. However, registering a branch entails the appointment of a local representative, who must be a natural person resident in Malta.
