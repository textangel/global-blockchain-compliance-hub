The GDPR stands for the General Data Protection Regulation and it will come into force on the 25th of May 2018 and will be directly applicable throughout all EU Member states.

Back in January of 2012, the European Commission [laid out its plans](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/index_en) for a full and comprehensive data protection reform that would be rolled out across the whole of the European Union with the aim of preparing for the digital age.

Nearly four years later, it is almost time for the laws to come into force, but there still appears to be a lot of confusion around what they entail.

‘Every aspect of our lives revolves around data and every kind of company from social media platforms, to banks, to that random furniture company that sends you a newsletter every 3 months, all store our personal information and the GDPR will apply to them.’

The GDPR will apply to every organisation that operates within the EU as well as any organisation that offers their goods or services to customers that are based within an EU member state.

In other words, every big business in the world that has any dealings with EU customers will have to be ready to comply with the GDPR or risk facing big fines.

The scope of the GDPR is huge and it would take a lot of time and space to go into every single nuance of it, but basically, the GDPR will enforce strict laws on how your data is collected, why it is collected, how you consented to its collection and how it is stored. It will also afford you the right for you to request that your data is either amended or removed without facing penalties such as disruption or refusal of service.

# Blockchain Nature vs GDPR

Under some circumstances, the GDPR could be referred to as a Digital Declaration of Rights and whilst its terms are comprehensive and far-reaching in some respects, they have failed to take into account many of the principles of blockchain technology.
