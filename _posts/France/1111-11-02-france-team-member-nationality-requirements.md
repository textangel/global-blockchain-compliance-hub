# Team Member Nationality Requirements

Citizens of EU/EEA countries (e.g., EU countries, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, etc.) do not need a visa to work in France. For all other citizenships, a work permit or residency permit is needed. 

In France, there are **two** types of permits with work authorization:
- Permanent resident permit: held by permanent residents, this allows you to bypass the work permit process.
- Provisional stay permit or short-stay visa: you must apply for permission permission to work. If approved, you may then apply for:
   - Temporary residency permit: when given for “private or family purposes,” usually comes with full work authorization *(except in the case of applicants from Algiers, Morocco, and Tunisia)*. 
   - Temporary work permit
   - Seasonal work contract

Generally speaking, to apply for a work permit, you must first have a job offer. The company will then arrange for a permit on your behalf. The application for a work permit, as well as more information about the permit types, can be found here (in French). 

## French Tech Visa

The visa is open to:
- Founders of French startups
- Employees of eligible companies
- Investors opening a venture capital firm in France

- Investors recruited by a French VC firm.
