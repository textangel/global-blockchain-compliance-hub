### Non-profit
An act to provide for the establishment of the non-governmental organisations regulatory commission for the supervision, coordination and monitoring of non-governmental organisations, civil society organisations etc in Nigeria and for related matters (HB585) is at the House of Representatives and has passed through the second reading. Bill was debated in plenary on July 14th 2016. The Bill has been referred to the Committee on CSOs and Development Partners for further legislative input.

While this bill is still being debated, the [Companies and Allied Matters Act, Cap C20, Laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 2004](http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text.jsp?file_id=222458) popularly known as “CAMA”, is the primary legislation regulating the registration of corporate entities in Nigeria.

Under CAMA there are two ways to register a not-for-profit organisation:
1. as incorporated trustees, or
2. as a company limited by guarantee
Incorporating trustees is far more popular and the procedure is laid out in Part C of CAMA.

Section 590(1) provides that:
_“where one or more trustees are appointed by any community of persons bound together by customs, religion, kinship or nationality or by any body or association of persons established for any religious, educational, literary, scientific, social, development, cultural, sporting or charitable purpose, he or they may if so authorized by the community, body or association…apply to the Commission in the manner hereafter provided for registration…as a corporate body.”_

Registration by Corporate Affairs Commission in Abuja and [online here](http://cac.gov.ng/) means the trustees jointly become a body corporate with perpetual succession and power to sue and be sued. A body corporate is a legal entity with its own rights and responsibilities. The trustees individually have the right to hold, acquire and transfer any property and enter contract on behalf of the organisation in the same form and manner as an individual. The trustees can, if they so choose, appoint a council or governing body which can include them and give it such administrative and management functions as they deem fit. Trustees will be subject to the directions of the association or of such council or governing body.

### For Profit:
Any company conducting business in Nigeria is required to register with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC). The process of registering a corporate entity has to be completed by a solicitor who has the approval to deal with the CAC.
 
There are two types of business entities in Nigeria:
1. Wholly foreign owned entities
- Foreign entrepreneurs interested in doing business in Nigeria can wholly own a limited liability company (LLC) with a minimum of 2 shareholders and 2 directors of any nationality. The minimum share capital is US$1 and the entire setup process can be completed within 6 weeks;
- Foreign corporations are unable to create a wholly foreign owned presence in the country by setting up a Nigeria branch office or Nigeria representative office. Nigeria’s companies law requires all foreign businesses desiring to do business in Nigeria to establish a company. None of these entities require Nigerian nationals to be involved as shareholders or resident directors;
- Free zone companies allow international entrepreneurs to import and export goods from the country with tax advantages on VAT and customs duties
 
2. Private limited company
- An LLC, referred to as the “Private limited company” in Nigeria, is the most common entity used for Nigeria company setup. As always, the company is a separate legal entity or person. In particular, a company is separate from its owners, shareholders, and the persons who run it, the directors.
 
The steps to processing the company registration are:
 
1. Check for availability of proposed company name [click here](http://publicsearch.cac.gov.ng/). [Read more about name reservation](http://new.cac.gov.ng/login) and Reserve a new Name   [click here](http://services.cac.gov.ng/login)
