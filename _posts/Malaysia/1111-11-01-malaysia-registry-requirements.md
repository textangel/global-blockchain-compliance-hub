### For-Profit

There are three types of for-profit companies in Malaysia, governed by the Companies Act of 2016.
1. Company limited by shares (also known as Sendirian Berhad or Sdn Bhd).
2. Company limited by guarantee.
3. Unlimited Company

In addition to ‘companies’, Malaysia has limited liability partnerships, which is a different business vehicle governed by the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2012. Partnerships and sole proprietorships also exist, but they need not be incorporated. [This link](https://asklegal.my/p/malaysian-business-types-how-to-choose-sdn-bhd-llp-partnership) is a great source on the pros/cons of differnet company types in Malaysia.

### Non-Profits
Nonprofits organizations are known as ‘societies’ in Malaysia. They need to be registered in accordance with the Societies Act of 1966.

2. Meeting shall approve the establishment of the following resolutions:-
    - Agreed on the establishment of the association

    - Appoint the members of the Committee to conduct registration sponsor organizations
    - Approve the constitution and rules of the society registered
    - Noting the establishment of the proceedings (minutes) organizations, including the resolutions mentioned above.” ([Source](http://www.ros.gov.my/index.php/en/soalan-lazim)).
Then, the documents should be brought to the local Registry of Societies (ROS) branch in Malaysia for incorporation. After registering, a society may apply for tax exemptions at the Tax Policy Department. ([Source](http://www.hati.my/faq/register-ngo-malaysia/))
