## **Non-profit Requirements**

Several forms of non-profit organizations that may have charitable purposes are: 
- Social relief establishments (“SRE”);
- Charitable funds (“Fund”);
- Associations;
- International non-governmental organizations (“INGO”);
- Scientific and technological organizations (“STO”); and
- Volunteer Groups. 

These organizations are different in terms of their establishment, operational purposes, functions, and state management. For example, the essential difference between an SRE and a Fund is that an SRE directly assists people in difficult situations, whereas a Fund only finances assistance. An INGO that is set up in a foreign country may carry out its activities in Vietnam once it obtains an appropriate permit. The main purposes of an INGO’s activities are to support development and to provide humanitarian aid. Beside non-profit organizations, the law also recognizes another type of charitable organization:, social enterprises. A social enterprise is an enterprise with a non-profit commitment to address social and environmental issues. 

International non-governmental organization (INGO): An INGO is an international non-governmental organization that has been established outside of Vietnam. The People’s Aid Coordination Committee (“PACCOM”) is the State body that licenses and manages INGOs. PACCOM has officers who are in charge of INGOs from particular geographic areas (e.g. Europe, North America, and the AsiaPacific region). PACCOM’s headquarters are in Hanoi, and it has a branch in Ho Chi Minh City. An INGO may operate under any one of three different permits: 
  - Permit to Operate; 
  - Permit to set up a Project Office; and 
  - Permit to establish a Representative Office. 

A Permit to Operate is the initial stage that is required if an INGO want to set up a Project Office or a Representative Office. The establishment and operation of INGOs is regulated by the Government’s Decree 12/2012/ND-CP dated March 1, 2012 on Registration and Operation Management of INGOs in Vietnam

**1. Permit to Operate:** In order to obtain a Permit to Operate, an INGO must have:

  2. Clear internal statutes, mandates, and objectives; 
  3. Already conducted or plans to conduct development or humanitarian projects and/or programs in Vietnam. 

The application for issuance of a Permit to Operate includes: Application letter; Charter of the INGO; and Document certifying the INGO's legal status (e.g. Establishment Certificate). It must be a notarized copy.

**2. Project Office:** In order to set up a Project Office, an INGO must obtain a Permit to Operate and must have projects and/or programs that have already been approved by competent Vietnamese authorities. The scope and nature of the projects or programs require regular on-site administration and supervision. The application to set up a Project Office should contain: 
- Application letter, which among other things, must provide the reasons for setting up a Project Office, its intended address, and the number of the Project Office’s expatriate and Vietnamese employees; 
- Original Permit to Operate; 
- Document certifying that the INGO has legal status (e.g. Establishment Certificate); 
- Profile of the person who will be chief of the Project Office;
- Approval by appropriate Vietnamese authorities of the projects/programs.

**3. Representative Office:** A Representative Office is only permitted to be located in either Hanoi, Da Nang, or Ho Chi Minh City. In order to establish a Representative Office, an INGO must: 
- Obtain a Permit to Operate; 
- Commit to operate over the long-term through projects and/or programs that have already been approved by competent Vietnamese authorities; and

The term of a Permit to Operate is three years from the date of issuance. The term of a Permit to set up a Project Office or a Permit to set up a Representative Office is five years from the date of issuance.
