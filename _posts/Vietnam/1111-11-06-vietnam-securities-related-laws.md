In 2018, the State Securities Commission (SSC) is tasked with building the revised Securities Law, which should be submitted for the National Assemblyâ€™s review in the sixth meeting in October. The amendment of the securities law will demonstrate the policies and guidelines of the Government in restructuring financial markets, State-owned enterprises, creating favorable investment environment for all investors and enhance transparency for businesses. Government officials are aware of the need for a legal foundation to govern cryptocurrencies, but it is unclear if the new Securities Law will address this.
