The Mexican government has been exploring the use of smart contracts but has not published any smart contract legislation. Therefore it remains unclear which party would bear the final responsibility/liability in case something went wrong 

**Current government smart contract initiatives** [(source)](https://www.gob.mx/cms/uploads/attachment/file/269552/Folleto_blockchain_HACKMX_oct2017_v6.pdf)
- The Digital Government Unit from the Ministry of Public Administration is responsible for promoting strategies and models of innovation in government management 
  - In collaboration with the Coordination of the National Digital Strategy, the Digital Government Unit is working on the creation of a Public Blockchain with the main goal of generating use cases of this technology in digital services 
  - **Blockchain HACKMX** is an initiative of the National Digital Strategy and the Ministry of Public Administration, in collaboration with Campus Talent Mexico
    - The main goal of Blockchain Hackmx is to generate case studies of using emerging technology to promote government digital innovation and the delivery of digital public services
    - **Smart Contract Blockchain HACKMX proposed use case**
      - The use case for smart contracts in Mexico specified that the proposed blockchain supplier would be Ethereum
          - In order to make a smart contract with Ethereum, a high level language like Solidity would be used 
    - The Mexican government sees smart contracts as a way to fight corruption but has not outlined specific applications for this technology as of yet
- **However, no specific laws around smart contracts have been published so, as of July 2018, it is unknown what party would bear final responsibility of something were to go wrong** [(source)](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=287ca25d-4a7c-4e4d-80db-dba31fb2c76f)
