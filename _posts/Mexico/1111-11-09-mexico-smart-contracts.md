As of August 2018, Mexico has not developed Distributed Ledger Technology laws or laws regarding smart contracts so the definition of a smart contract and whether a smart contract is legally binding remains unclear. 

However, the **Blockchain HACKMX** report introduced a smart contract as “A contract is a collection of code (its functions) and data (its status) residing in a specific address in the Ethereum blockchain. Contract accounts are able to exchange messages between them, as well as do pretty much the entire Turing calculation.” [(source)](https://www.gob.mx/cms/uploads/attachment/file/269552/Folleto_blockchain_HACKMX_oct2017_v6.pdf)
- This definition is not legally binding.
