For federal requirements, please visit the [USA Who Bears Final Responsibility and Liability page](https://neo-project.github.io/global-blockchain-compliance-hub//united-states-of-america/USA-final-liability.html). 

Under New Jersey securities laws, the financial services company or broker is responsible for complying with New Jersey securities laws. See above section on securities-related laws and recent emergency orders from the New Jersey Bureau of Securities shutting down several cryptocurrency exchanges that were listing unregistered securities.
