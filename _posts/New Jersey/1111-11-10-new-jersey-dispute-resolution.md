For federal regulations, please visit the [USA How is Dispute Resolution Integrated page](https://neo-project.github.io/global-blockchain-compliance-hub//united-states-of-america/USA-dispute-resolution.html). 


There's no current legislation on smart-contract-related dispute resolution in New Jersey.
