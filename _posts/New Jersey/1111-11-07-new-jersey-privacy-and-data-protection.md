For federal requirements, please visit the [USA Privacy & Data Protection-Related Laws page](https://neo-project.github.io/global-blockchain-compliance-hub//united-states-of-america/USA-privacy-and-data-protection.html). 
 
The Office of the New Jersey Attorney General (AG’s Office) recently [announced](http://nj.gov/oag/newsreleases18/pr20180507b.html) that it will be creating a new civil enforcement unit, known as the Data Privacy & Cybersecurity Section (DPC Section), to investigate data breaches impacting New Jersey residents and to enforce federal and state data privacy and cybersecurity laws. New Jersey’s AG joins an expanding list of state AGs, including those of California, Connecticut, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, and North Carolina, who are dedicating more resources to data breach investigation and enforcement actions.
