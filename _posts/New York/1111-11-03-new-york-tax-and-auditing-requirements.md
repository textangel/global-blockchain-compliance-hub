In addition to US federal taxes, businesses must file and pay the franchise tax on general business corporations if:
- You are a domestic corporation (incorporated in New York State); or
- You are a foreign corporation (incorporated outside New York State) that does business, employs capital, owns or leases property, maintains an office, or derives receipts from activity, in New York State; or
- You are a foreign corporation that is a general partner in a partnership that does business, employs capital, owns or leases property, maintains and office, or derives receipts from activity, in New York State; or
- You are a foreign corporation that is a limited partner in a partnership that does business, employs capital, owns or leases property, maintains an office, or derives receipts from activity, in New York State and you are engaged directly or indirectly, in the participation or in the domination or control of all or any portion of the business activities or affairs of the partnership.

When considering the last 2 bullets above, an LLC or LLP that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes will be treated as a partnership for New York State tax purposes. Corporations engaged in a unitary business with another corporation(s) should see Form CT-3-A-I, page 4, “Who must file a combined return” for information concerning the combined return filing requirements.

**Calculating the tax:**

Highest tax based on: 
- [Business income](https://www.tax.ny.gov/bus/ct/def_art9a.htm#eni)
- [Business capital](https://www.tax.ny.gov/bus/ct/def_art9a.htm#business%20base)
- [Fixed dollar minimum tax](https://www.tax.ny.gov/bus/ct/def_art9a.htm#fix%20min%20tax) 
MTA surcharge 
- [Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA surcharge)](https://www.tax.ny.gov/bus/ct/def_art9a.htm#mta) if applicable

**Tax Credits**
- You may qualify to claim certain [tax credits](https://www.tax.ny.gov/bus/ct/article9a_tax_credits.htm) to reduce your New York State tax liability. 

**Paying Estimated Tax**

If your corporation reasonably expects to owe more than $1,000 in franchise tax after credits, you must file estimated tax forms (Form CT-400, Estimated Tax for Corporations) and make quarterly payments of all [estimated tax](https://www.tax.ny.gov/bus/ct/def_art9a.htm#est%20tax) due. Most general business corporations are [mandated](https://www.tax.ny.gov/bus/efile/elf_busn_mandate.htm) to e-file the estimated tax.
- Use [Corporation Tax Web File](https://www.tax.ny.gov/bus/efile/ctwebfile.htm) to submit Form CT-400. You will need to first create an [Online Services account](https://www.tax.ny.gov/online/default.htm) **or**
