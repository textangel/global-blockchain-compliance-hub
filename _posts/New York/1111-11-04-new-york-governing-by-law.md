## Corporate Bylaws
When starting a corporation in the state of New York, a certain set of bylaws set forth between members and managers of a business can be created. What this will do is allow business owners to have a written document proving that all relevant parties have agreed upon the rules and regulations set in place. This document will prove useful when future disputes between members arise. Within this agreement there are a number of important provisions defined that were previously left undocumented. This agreement is not required in New York, though it can be very useful for varied legal matters. It is recommended that founders work with a lawyer to draft corporate bylaws. Bylaws usually include sections with information about:
- Corporate Authority
- Offices
- Shareholders
- Directors 
- Waiver of Notice
- Committees 
- Officers and Board of Directors
- Indemnification
- Certificates for Shares
- Dividends 
- General Provisions
- Right of First Refusal
- Amendments 

There are many online templates available for writing bylaws. Here are some useful ones:
