The State of New York has not yet published any laws defining smart contracts. However, on November 27, 2017,  [New York Assembly Bill 8780](https://legiscan.com/NY/text/A08780/2017) was proposed to amend the state’s technology law to include definitions for “blockchain technology” and “smart contract” and provide a legal understanding for digital signatures stored on a blockchain. If implemented, this bill would allow for signatures, records and contracts secured through blockchain technology to be recognized as valid electronic representations and therefore operate in commerce.
